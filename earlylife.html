        <h2><em>Who did he use to be?</em></h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">Anakin Skywalker was born into slavery on the desert world of Tatooine, raised by his mother Shmi under harsh conditions that taught him resilience, compassion, and a longing for freedom. Though he lived in poverty, he displayed extraordinary talents from a young age—instinctively understanding machines, building his own droid C-3PO, and piloting a podracer with reflexes no normal human possessed. His mysterious birth, with no biological father, hinted at a powerful connection to the Force that set him apart even before he understood it. Despite the cruelty of life as a slave, Anakin remained hopeful and kind, dreaming of exploring the stars beyond his desert home. His abilities caught the attention of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, who recognized the boy’s immense potential and believed he was the Chosen One foretold to bring balance to the Force. After winning his freedom through a dangerous podrace, Anakin left Tatooine behind, heartbroken to leave his mother but determined to begin a new life. This combination of brilliance, emotional depth, and early hardship laid the foundation for both his heroic rise and his tragic fall.</p>
